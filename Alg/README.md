#Alg Project
Contains Coords and LinearEquation, two libraries of functions.  Read more below:

##Coords
Library of functions that play around with basic coordinate geometry

####getX()
Returns x value of a Coords object as a double.

####getY()
Returns y value of a Coords object as a double.

####equals(Coords other)
Returns a boolean; true if two Coords objects are equal to each other, false if not.

####setX()
Parameter is passed in as an x-value.

####setY()
Parameter is passed in as a y-value.

####translate()
* If two parameters are passed in; the first is applied to the existing x value as a horizontal shift, and the second is applied to the existing y value as a vertical shift.
* If one parameter is passed in, that value mutates both the existing x and y values.

##LinearEquation
Library of functions that play around with linear equations.
