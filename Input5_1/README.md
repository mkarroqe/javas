#Input5_1: Lesson 2
Exploring keyboard input and the Scanner class.

### Program:
This program has 3 methods beyond the main method: `sup()`, `numAvg()`, and `randy()`.

##### `Sup()`
This method asks for your name and greets you, and then asks for your age.  It tells you how old you will be next year, and comments on that age.

##### `numAvg()`
This method asks for the user to input numbers.  When the user is finished inputing their numbers, they are prompted to type "-999."  Next, the program presents the sum of the inputted numbers and the average of them.

##### `randy()`
This method generates random "PSAT scores" from a range of 20-80.
