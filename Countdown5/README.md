#A Lesson in Overloading Functions
There are several methods in this program, each piggie-backing off each other.

###Notes
Overloading functions: helps w not repeating code
	* Static vs Nonstatic methods:
	  -   static is a stand alone method
  	-   Scanner is not static, it builds from the Scanner object
  	-   Math.random is static, call it by class name, doesn't require another object
  * void - the method does not return anything
